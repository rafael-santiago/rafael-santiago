Hi! :wave:

I am a computer scientist (and yes, I find this title I little bit pompous) and software developer/writer/engineer
(I prefer these ones).

Personally I find that on CompSci the equivalent of a theorem is a wise and problem solver code being well-executed within
a CPU.

So, nice to meet you, I am a practical guy, even having some theoretic instruction.

My main areas of interest on programming are [crypto](https://www.cryptoisnotcryptocurrency.com), network, kernel hacking (Unix and Windows), information security as whole
(bad and construtive stuff, but I only do the bad into well-controlled environments for learning, practice issues),
compilers and music. I have been working with Information Security for more than a decade.

Since I started on programming I have been hooked on C and low-level programming.

My programming languages of choice (in order) are: ``C``, ``Go``, ``Assembly`` (``IA-32/64``), ``C++``, ``Shell``. So it is
what you can find here but in a non-orthodox way because this is my thing! :wink:

:vulcan_salute:!

*PS*: My [guitar-tabs](https://github.com/rafael-santiago/guitar-tabs) repository is encrypted and
I am not intending to share my mistakes and lousy arrangements with no one. This is about tabs
that I have been transcribing since 13 years old (!), it is very personal, please do not ask for
password or the plain tulip source files of mine. Definitely, I am not a well-behaved guy when
thinking about music... You could learn my mistakes! :joy:

Thanks!
