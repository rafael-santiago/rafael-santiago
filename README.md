Hi!

I am a computer scientist (and yes, I find this title I little bit pompous) and software developer/writer/engineer
(I prefer these ones).

Personally I find that on CompSci the equivalent of a theorem is a wise and problem solver code being well-executed within
a CPU.

So, much pleasure, I am a practical guy, even having some theoretic instruction.

My main areas of interest on programming are crypto, network, kernel hacking (Unix and Windows), information security as whole
(:smiling_imp: and :angel: stuff, but I only do the bad into well-controlled environments for learning, practice issues),
compilers and music. I have been working with Information Security for more than a decade.

Since I started on programming I have been hooked on C and low-level programming. I am not much for frameworks and also just
coding with training wheels or just tightening screws... Sorry for the rhyme, sad rhyme by the way!... If you want to learn
something and as a result pushing your skills, you need to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty ``while(1);``.
Easy/flat/well-behaved code teach you nothing! :exploding_head:

My programming languages of choice (in order) are: ``C``, ``Go``, ``Assembly`` (``IA-32/64``), ``C++``, ``Shell``. So it is
what you can find here but in a non-orthodox way because this is my thing! :wink:

Like a popular brazilian adage says:
>"Quem anda muito na linha o trem passa por cima!"
